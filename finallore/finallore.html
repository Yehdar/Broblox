        In the final chamber, you decipher a complex sequence just as the timer
        hits zero. The door opens, and you escape the factory. The tormentor's
        tragic backstory is revealed through a hologram: a scientist who lost
        all in an accident. His experiment was a twisted attempt at redemption.
        You leave with empathy, forever changed by the experience, hoping he too
        found his escape.
