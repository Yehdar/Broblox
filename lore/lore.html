    <p>
      Locked within an abandoned factory, you wake up in a dimly lit room, a
      countdown timer on the wall. A voice reveals that you're part of a
      sinister experiment. To survive, solve diabolical puzzles within each room
      before time runs out. Fail, and face deadly consequences. As you progress,
      you unearth the tormentor's backstory, a tragic figure seeking to test
      human limits after his own life shattered. Navigate eerie rooms, solve
      puzzles under pressure, and unveil the twisted tale of "Escape: Chamber of
      Trials." Your survival depends on wit, speed, and nerves of steel.
